## Advanced Apriori Results Filtering

```yaml
type: TitleSlide
key: 2b7d20f97a
```

`@lower_third`
name: Isaiah Hull

`@script`
Filtering Apriori algorithm results by standard metrics won't always yield useful association rules. When this happens, we'll need to apply advanced filtering techniques, making use of multiple metrics, custom metrics, aggregation, and other strategies.

## Use Cases

```yaml
type: TwoColumns
key: 67612cd0e6
```

`@part1`
**Cross-Promotion**{{1}}

![This image shows an example of cross-promotion.](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5627/datasets/7d53a15e6a7b12cd466e85a19282d78a0dae9db6/cross_promotion_34.jpg = 45){{1}}

`@part2`
**Aggregation**{{2}}

![This image shows an example of aggregation.](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5627/datasets/44f74a9d28f45bf0564238b2b0eb89e6393545d1/aggregation_bags_wordcloud_34.jpg = 65){{2}}

`@script`
In this video, we'll apply advanced filtering techniques to a set of transactions from a UK-based novelty gift store. 

We'll consider two use cases: 1) using cross-promotion to sell a targeted consequent; and 2) using aggregation and Zhang's metric to select the layout for a new store.

## The Apriori Algorithm

```yaml
type: TwoRowsTwoColumns
key: cc896721f5
```

`@part1`
**List of Lists**{{1}}

![This image shows an example of a list of lists of the items in transactions.](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5627/datasets/2192016f6eba1331c66ee80fc4c11775c3eb884b/list_of_lists_34.jpg = 50){{1}}

`@part2`
**One-Hot Encoding**{{2}}

![This image shows the one-hot encoding of transactions.](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5627/datasets/64e0cf45cdb7b06bd927fd48d376484770e5eb01/onehot_34.jpg = 50){{2}}

`@part3`
**Apriori Algorithm**{{3}}

![This image illustrates the Apriori algorithm being applied to a generic set of 4 items.](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5627/datasets/7a690536a39cd484d0600314411f824e58f83eba/apriori_34.jpg = 50){{3}}

`@part4`


`@script`
For both use cases, we'll start with a list of of lists. We'll then one-hot encode the itemsets and apply the Apriori algorithm. Remember that the Apriori algorithm performs pruning by applying the Apriori principle: subsets of frequent itemsets are also frequent.

---

## The Apriori Algorithm

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 16488f3f4e
code_zoom: 70
```

`@part1`
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori
```{{1}}

```python
# Load list of itemsets
itemsets = np.load('itemsets.npy')

# One-hot encode itemsets
encoder = TransactionEncoder()
onehot = encoder.fit(itemsets).transform(itemsets)

# Convert to pandas dataframe
data = pd.DataFrame(onehot, columns = encoder.columns_)
```{{2}}

```python
# Apply Apriori algorithm
frequent_itemsets = apriori(data, use_colnames=True)
```{{3}}

`@script`
Let's recall how we can implement this as code. We'll first import pandas, numpy, TransactionEncoder from mlxtend dot preprocessing, and apriori from mlxtend dot frequent_patterns. We'll then instantiate an transaction encoder, encode the transactions in one-hot format, and then transform the one-hot encoded data into a pandas dataframe.

Finally, we'll apply the Apriori algorithm, yielding the subset of itemsets that are frequent.

---

## Apriori Algorithm Results

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 4bbb5015b9
code_zoom: 80
```

`@part1`
```python
# Print number of itemsets
print(len(data.columns))
```{{1}}

```out
4201
```{{2}}

```python
# Print number of itemsets after pruning
print(len(frequent_itemsets))
```{{3}}

```out
2328
```{{4}}

```python
# Compute standard metrics
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets)
```{{5}}

`@script`
We now have a list of frequent itemsets and their supports. Notice that Apriori pruned the list from 4,201 itemsets to 2,328. We can now recover the standard set of metrics by applying the association_rules() function we imported earlier.

---

## Association Rules

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: d326fa9d86
code_zoom: 80
```

`@part1`
```python
print(print(rules['consequents']))
```{{1}}

```out
0                   (DOTCOM POSTAGE)
					    ... 
9				 (HERB MARKER THYME)
					    ...
234        (JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT)
235         (WOODLAND CHARLOTTE BAG)
236    (RED RETROSPOT CHARLOTTE BAG)
237       (STRAWBERRY CHARLOTTE BAG)
238      (CHARLOTTE BAG SUKI DESIGN)
Name: consequents, Length: 239, dtype: object
```{{2}}

`@script`
This yields 239 rules. Now, let's say we show this list to the store manager and she tells us to cross-promote the the thyme herb marker.

---

## Filtering with Multiple Metrics

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: b2eb8be4b0
code_zoom: 80
```

`@part1`
```python
# Extract rules with herb marker thyme as consequent
targeted_rules = rules[rules['consequents'] == {'HERB MARKER THYME'}].copy()
```{{1}}

```python
# Filter rules using four metrics
filtered_rules = targeted_rules[(targeted_rules['antecedent support'] > 0.01) &
						(targeted_rules['support'] > 0.009) &
						(targeted_rules['confidence'] > 0.86) &
						(targeted_rules['lift'] > 0.82)].copy()
```{{2}}

```python
print(filtered_rules['antecedents'])
```{{3}}

```out
9        (HERB MARKER BASIL)
25     (HERB MARKER PARSLEY)
27    (HERB MARKER ROSEMARY)
Name: antecedents, dtype: object
```{{4}}

`@script`
We can start by restricting the set of rules to those that have "herb marker thyme" as the consequent. We'll then apply a multi-metric filter that requires the antecedent's support to be greater than 1%, the rule's support to be greater than 0.009, the confidence to be greater than 0.85, and the lift to be greater than 0.82.

Printing the results, we can see that basil, parsley, or rosemary herb markers could be used to cross-promote the thyme herb marker.

## Grouping Products

```yaml
type: TwoRowsTwoColumns
key: 46bf2ea683
```

`@part1`
![The image shows a store floorplan where boxes are grouped with signs and candles are grouped with bags.](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5627/datasets/0345b719965de031e9c457cc56f5fe14349ed1d2/product_pairing_3_34.png = 35){{1}}

`@part2`

![The image shows a store floorplan where boxes are grouped with bags and signs are grouped with candles.](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5627/datasets/5ce97845f8ad0a191388984a3e92e0c27e5fdd92/product_pairing_1_34.png = 35){{3}}

`@part4`


`@script`
Let's look at another quick example of advanced filtering. The store we're advising is re-locating to a new building that is shaped like a horseshoe. The manager is trying to decide how to arrange the sections of the store and wants our input. She offers three options: group boxes and bags together, and signs and candles together. Group boxes and candles, and signs and bags. Or group boxes and signs, and candles and bags.

She tells us that our objective should be to keep disassociated items far apart. That means we need to use Zhang's metric.

---

## Aggregation and Disassociation

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: e362caf79c
code_zoom: 80
```

`@part1`
```python
# Aggregate itemsets into four categories
aggregated = aggregate_data(itemsets, ['bag','box','candle','sign'])
```{{1}}

```
# Compute frequent itemsets
onehot = encoder.fit(aggregated).transform(aggregated)
data = pd.DataFrame(onehot, columns = encoder.columns_)
frequent_itemsets = apriori(data, use_colnames=True)
```{{2}}

```
# Compute standard metrics
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets)
```{{3}}

```
# Compute Zhang's rule
rules['zhang'] = zhangsRule(rules)
```{{4}}

`@script`
We'll start by performing aggregation, using the function we defined earlier in the chapter. This will identify all of the bags, boxes, candles, and signs in the list of itemsets and will discard everything else. We'll then apply Zhang's rule, which we defined in Chapter 2. Recall that Zhang's rule yields values of between -1 and 1, where -1 captures perfect disassociation and 1 captures perfect association.

---

## Zhang's Rule

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 0265bdfd72
```

`@part1`
```python
# Print rules that indicate disassociation
print(rules[rules['zhang'] < 0][['antecedents','consequents']])
```{{1}}

```out
  antecedents consequents
2       (bag)    (candle)
3    (candle)       (bag)
4      (sign)       (bag)
5       (bag)      (sign)
```{{2}}

`@script`
Let's print the results and recall that our assignment was to avoid grouping disassociated items. We can quickly see that bags and candles and signs and bags should not be paired.

## Selecting a Floorplan

`@part4`


`@script`
We can rule out two of the proposed floor plans, leaving us with the one where bags and boxes are paired.
